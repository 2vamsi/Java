/*  Abstract class will have implemented and unimplemented methods.
 ( where as interface can have only unimplemented methods
 
 	keyword - abstract
 
 Here also, We Cannot create object of Abstract class, because all methods are not implemented.


 But, We Can write constructor in Abstract class. ( we can not write a constructor in case of interface)


 To make class Abstract class we need to have at least one method as Abstract method. 
 ( because - without abstract method, there is no point in writing abstract class)


 We can create Reference of Abstract class and object of child class.


To create abstract class :  While creating a class, after entering the class name select abstract checkbox
